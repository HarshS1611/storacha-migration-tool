# Storacha Migration Tool

This project is a tool for transfering files from an S3 bucket directly to Storacha using [w3up-client](https://docs.storacha.network/w3up-client/), without downloading them locally. You can achieve this using [AWS SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) for JavaScript to fetch the file as a stream and then pass it to Storachaâ€™s uploadFile.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- A Storacha account

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Storacha email:

    ```
